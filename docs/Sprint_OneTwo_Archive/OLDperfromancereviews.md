# Team Reviews

## Jenna's Team Performance Review -

Everyone is great to work with, but overall we didn't meet a lot of the coding deadlines for this first sprint, so I think we need to re-evaluate some of our methods and planning.
(Understandable we have other classes and most of us have jobs- just need to find a way to work around this!)
Instead of just one big deadline near the end of the sprint, I think that we should have multiple "smaller" deadlines so that we can keep up with each other's progress.
This will help us keep on track with the project more throughout future sprints. More meetings would help too, as at times only one or two people showed up to the dedicated meeting times;
if the scheduled class time isn't a good time for us to meet, then we should discuss this and figure out a better time for the future.
More communication would be great. If you can't meet a deadline then you should let everyone know so that we can help/finish what needs to be done; I think we would all be understanding as long as you give
ample time for us to come up with a solution.
### Team-mate assesments:

Jurez - Great to work with and really helpful- met all deadlines this time. The Account class works great and is documented well with docstrings. Same for the Database module- no errors have been found by me.
Showed up to pretty much every meeting and always contributed ideas and helped with planning.

Pratik - Great work with the code, the HTML worked great and only needed a few changes to work with the Bottle framework. Very receptive to ideas and also offered his own thoughts which helped a lot.
Due to conflicting assignments/tests wasn't able to come to every meeting in the class.

Wasif - Great code work and awesome to work with, always comes up with new ideas and features and has a plan for implementing them. Very helpful when asked for advice too.
Wasn't able to meet the primary deadline due to conflicting assignments/tests, communication beforehand would have helped in this case.

## Jurez's Team Performance Review -

The first team sprint had a few buckles, but overall the majority of us were able to meet our original deadline.
There are definitely alot of thing we can work on collectively as a group. A few suggestions that I have for our next
sprint are as followed:
1. We should communicate the interface of our class to one another by a specified deadline preferably within the
first week. That way if another team member has to implement some service that depends on the work of another person
or the team in general, then the other team members will be able to work on their tasks without having to
 wait for someone to complete their tasks.
2. I personally found our in person meetings to be more effective, and I'm open to meeting up outside of class times,
if we can't all make it to scheduled class times. I feel like in person meetings allow us to hold ourselves accountable,
and should encourage more team productivity.

### Team-mate assesments:

1. Jenna - Was very easy to work with, she is a good communicator and an effective worker. Jenna played a major part
 in the initial planning of the project sprint, and was always willing to make suggestions, she met the original
 pull request deadline.
2. Pratik - Pratik met the original deadline, and was always willing to make any changes to his work that was suggested
by the team. His is very easy to work with, and an effective worker. However, due to scheduling conflicts he missed the initial
meetings when the project was planned out.
3. Wasif - Wasif helped with initial planning of the project and has a lot of good ideas. However, due to scheduling
conflicts he was unable to attend some meetings, and he could not meet the original pull request deadline.

# Pratik's Team Performance Review-
1. jenna - did an excellect job, did al the task according, she always showed up , she got her hand full due to lot of assignments
but always did her part and she always was ready to help. brilliant team member.
2. jurez- basically a team leader in my opinion , corridated everyone so well and planned everthing out with assigning all the task
and made sure everything was done. 
3. wasif- always there to help , he played his role pretty well, so good with other teammates and did his job at best.

## Wasif's Team Performance Review-

Working with this team has been a positive experience characterized by strong work ethics and a collective commitment to project success. We haven't encountered significant issues during our collaboration, although we did face some challenges due to project deadlines coinciding with midterms â€“ a situational factor beyond anyone's control.

### Team-mate assesments:

1. Jenna: Jenna has been an exceptional collaborator. She excels in clarifying tasks, proactively seeks solutions outside of regular hours, and consistently delivers work efficiently. Jenna's extensive knowledge has significantly contributed to the project's success, especially in shaping its direction.
2. Pratik: He did an excellent job on the project. His code worked seamlessly with the Bottle framework, and he was receptive to suggestions while also offering valuable insights.
3. Jurez: Jurez is a knowledgeable team member who takes the initiative to schedule meetings outside of class for work discussions. He plays a vital role in code-related discussions and maintains active engagement through our online group chat on Discord.

In summary, it's been a pleasure working with this diligent team. We've effectively navigated challenges through resilience and teamwork, and I look forward to achieving more together.
