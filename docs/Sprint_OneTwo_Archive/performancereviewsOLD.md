### Pratik's Team Performance Review-

This sprint was much better then the first spirit as we are getting more familiar with the enviroment and team member , one thing i didnt like is team member which are assigned a task which someone else do it, we can work on that, not a big deal, the intention is to help we know that it just has created conflict on code so better communitcation we can look into that.
and for over documentation part we have to work , we need to give more time on it as well so the marker can see what is done by who better. it is only going to be better as we got more experience. i like that we all discuss the pull req in each meeting and then only we merge it if there is no conflict and all agree with the pull req.
we did more meeting , off class meeting were good addition.

## sprint 2 team performance review-
1. jenna - a good teammate, did everything before deadline , her work was on point . her idea of my reviews page was so good. just that she did some off my assigned task but that fine. she attended every metting and was always there working on her code. she was the in charge of whether to accept a pull req or not around the deadline time , she told everyone that she will be strict on the deadline and made us understand that if we past deadline it will be tough on the team progrees i am glad she she did her role as she is supposed to do Effort expended on topic: 10

3. wasif - always has a great idea in his mind, he is always brainstorming idea nad that make up for our team spirit , and his code was also great written. he missed the deadline for pull req for some reason but he was very supportive , like everyone did so well on this sprint and we can see the improvement , he was the one who always give out good idea and attended every meeting , he always came forward and never hesitate to ask like what he need to chnage on my html files, as putting a delete button and implementing stuff was his idea, i think we worked good together.Effort expended on topic: 9

## Wasif's Team Performance Review-

As the second sprint comes to an end, all In have to say is we worked better as a team. I was lacking in some aspects
in the first sprint which I tried to cover up in this sprint and I still believe I haven't been the best of teammates.
I struggled getting work done by the deadline and I apologize for doing so. However, the team knows as I discussed with
them every meeting how I was putting together my code and gave them progress reports for it.As for how the team 
performed I have listed down my honest thoughts for each member below.

### Team-mate assesments:
Jenna: Jenna has been an amazing team member, always the first to show up to meetings and helping out whenever needed. What
we lacked however, was communication. Some better communication between her and myself would have ensured processes were
flowing more smoothly.

Jurez: Jurez offers an ear to each of my ideas and always helps me with implementation of said ideas. He ha been a crucial
part of this team and I have learnt a lot from him. However, for the last wrap up I believed that the final meeting would take
place on the last day and we were supposed to merge our code before that. I asked Jurez to help me complete my part and he 
agreed as we had problems with pull requests before as well. However,due to a misunderstanding on my part I missed the deadline,
but I believe a heads up for said deadline should have been emphasized in the meeting.

Pratik: Pratik is a teammate I respect, doesn't say much, completes the task at hand and brings new ideas to the table.
However, the part I was working on coincided with his and sometimes it was difficult to rach him to get these tasks done.
Regardless, he has been an amazing teammate and I look forward to working with him in the future


### Jurez's Team Performance Review-

Overall I would say that our team improved in some aspects, and that we also encountered new problems in our second sprint.
The attendance to meetings dramatically improved for the most part, and communication was alot better. However, in this sprint
I think we all are starting to realize how important having a robust pull request process is. We did not have much trouble with 
this issue in our first sprint, prehaps because we had more time and because the tasks weren't as challenging. But now we
are starting to see how the pull request process can affect the progress of the project as a whole. In our next sprint,
we will have to make sure that whenever there is a pull request issued, and there is a merge into the master branch, we all
should update our local branches to reflect this change. Perhaps we can do this remotely, if we can determine a time where we
all will be online, so that we can all participate in the code review, and we call all update our master branches, and individual 
work branches together. This is the only way all of our collective efforts will be incorporated into our final product.
This issue aside, I would still say we all participated more in our meetings. 

##### Team-mate assesments:

In our meeting notes we agreed to use this criteria scheme with a rating of 1-10:

Effort expended on topic:
Communication with team:
Participation in critical reviews:
Attending team meetings:

1. Jenna attended every meeting , participated in every pull request and code review
   ,she is also always accessible to talk about planning the project. She is very keen to
   point out whenever a new bug arises, and played a major role in the progress of the project.

2. Wasif attended nearly all of the meetings, and also attended additional meetings on the weekend.
   He completed all of his work, however he was unable to open pull requests on the deadlined days. 
   In spite of this one shortfall, he still played a significant role in planning out the new features
   of the project, and he is a great communicator.

   3. Pratik likewise attended nearly all meetings, and attended additional meetings on the weekend. 
      As previously discussed, a pull request was opened on each of the deadline dates, however some 
      of these request had to be closed because of their being to many conflicts with the master branch.
      On our last deadline date some of these conflicting files were still in his branch, and this prevented
      us from merging in his branch. We have already attributed this issue to be due to inappropriately assigning
      Pratik the task of unit testing a module he did not design, which lead to the initial problem of a conflicting
      account and database module.

## Jenna's Team Performance Review
* I believe that we did better than our first sprint in terms of documentation and meeting the backlog requests the professor gave to us, but there were still a lot of problems that we have to address for the final sprint.
* Attendance is still an issue; sometimes teammates wouldn't check in for more than a week, leading to them missing out on information such as deadlines or task changes.
  * We have aimed to resolve this with our new process of having daily check-ins; this way, we can communicate information during these check-ins and also see how each our assigned tasks are progressing, so that if there are any issues we can resolve them right away instead of not being informed of them until a week later.
  * This will also hopefully solve problems with communication; where team members were confused about deadlines and the tasks they should be doing.
  * For the final sprint, we should aim to add deadlines + task assignments to the README right away, so they are clear and evident to all team members on the front page of the repo.
* We also had problems with our pull requests- a lot of pull requests had to be rejected because they resulted in too many conflicts with the master branch. As well, some pull requests that were accepted still caused problems that we had to resolve after deadlines.
  * We have aimed to resolve this with a new pull request process that involves thorough code reviews by the entire team before any pull request is merged. As well, pull requests will not be accepted at all if they have any conflicts with the main branch.
  * As well, we will enforce that branches be kept updated so that everyone is always working on the newest version of the project.
* Some of our documentation is also very different in terms of format from team member to team member
  * This can be resolved by making a "template" near the beginning of sprint, so that everyone has a guideline to work off of.
* Overall, we have improved since the first sprint, but we still have a lot more to improve upon for the final sprint. 

### Teammate Assessments
1. Jurez
   * Personality wise, Jurez is a great person to work with; he's incredible charismatic and a great team-player who is always looking out for others on the team.
   * Jurez attended every meeting with the exception of one; however this was a meeting we knew he wouldn't be able to attend because of work, so we knew well in advance and it wasn't an issue.
   * He was always around to help other teammates when issues arrive, and he offered new ideas and features at every meeting to help better the project.
   * He participated in every review, and was the first to look at the feedback from the first sprint and help us find ways to improve for this one.
   * Overall, he was a great part of the project who acted as a leader throughout the sprint, and was a huge part of the project.

2. Wasif
    * Overall, a really great person to work with- he's very friendly and always willing to work things out. He's very easy to talk to and great at coming up with ideas.
    * His attendance this time was much better compared to the last sprint; and he was always the one to suggest extra meetings outside of class time to get work done.
    * As noted in the Team Performance Review, we had some issues communicating deadlines that caused some of his work to not be pushed to the master branch by the deadline.
      * This issue could be resolved by being more clear with deadlines; and by stating that all deadlines are final so that there is no confusion
    * He had issues with getting some of his code to work; but he was very clear when these issues were happening and was quick to seek help from other members.
    * There was some issues with us working on the same tasks at one point- this is again a product of lack of communication between the team on who would be doing what
      * This issue could be fixed by frequent checking of the KanBan board, and making sure the KanBan board is up to date and accurate during meetings.
    * A great team member to work with who writes great code; hopefully with better team communication we won't have any issues next sprint.

3. Pratik
   * A good person to work with; he is friendly and really great at coding. The server module that I worked on wouldn't work nearly as well without the great HTML work he did to support it.
   * He had some issues with the pull requests this time- this was partly due to use not having a clear pull request process at the beginning of the sprint, and partly due to him not updating his branch to match the master branch.
     * He was very understanding when this problem brought forward, and worked together with Jurez to fix this issue.
     * I believe he has learned a lot and this issue will not be a problem in the final sprint.
   * There were still a few missed meetings on his part, but overall attendance was much improved compared to the first sprint.
   * Due to us not really developing our code review process until near the end of the sprint, he didn't participate in as many code reviews
     * This was a team issue more than a personal issue, and hopefully he will be able to attend code review sessions in the future sprint.
   * Overall, very easy to work with and very receptive to criticism- hopefully our new process for the final sprint will fix any issues above.
