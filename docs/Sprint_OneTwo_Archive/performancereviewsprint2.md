## Wasif's Team Performance Review-

As the second sprint comes to an end, all In have to say is we worked better as a team. I was lacking in some aspects
in the first sprint which I tried to cover up in this sprint and I still believe I haven't been the best of teammates.
I struggled getting work done by the deadline and I apologize for doing so. However, the team knows as I discussed with
them every meeting how I was putting together my code and gave them progress reports for it.As for how the team 
performed I have listed down my honest thoughts for each member below.

### Team-mate assesments:
Jenna: Jenna has been an amazing team member, always the first to show up to meetings and helping out whenever needed. What
we lacked however, was communication. Some better communication between her and myself would have ensured processes were
flowing more smoothly.

Jurez: Jurez offers an ear to each of my ideas and always helps me with implementation of said ideas. He ha been a crucial
part of this team and I have learnt a lot from him. However, for the last wrap up I believed that the final meeting would take
place on the last day and we were supposed to merge our code before that. I asked Jurez to help me complete my part and he 
agreed as we had problems with pull requests before as well. However,due to a misunderstanding on my part I missed the deadline,
but I believe a heads up for said deadline should have been emphasized in the meeting.

Pratik: Pratik is a teammate I respect, doesn't say much, completes the task at hand and brings new ideas to the table.
However, the part I was working on coincided with his and sometimes it was difficult to rach him to get these tasks done.
Regardless, he has been an amazing teammate and I look forward to working with him in the future
