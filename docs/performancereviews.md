# Pratik's Reviews
Written by: Pratik

Team performance 

Overview - with every sprint everyone is getting better and better in term of communication and knowing a teammate skills , this sprint we put out a deadline very early to avoid late submission which will result in compromising our work , and everyone followed it as well,  in our final meeting we were proud of what we have made , with the help of the team. We did have some issue this sprint as first we had a vague idea about the new features we are adding, as it was new for some of us , example for making a scheduler and letting the user know about a late submission . But we took some small small step we could see the implementation of it. For me personally , the biggest problem was the work load on a particular time , because I have to wait for my team to implement their ideas on server side than I can do my work on front as html , if they want a button added , then also I have to wait , but we realized this issue starting of the sprint , so we started brainstorming and we figure out a way that one teammate had to atleast make one html code , I can be done with the help of me so it was not like we are telling a person to learn something new , I feel like the idea was like a call for help to take some stress of me. 

Jureez - always great to work with , he was the one who did the team assign part , he never hesitated to ask for help as he told about the dropdown menu adding on his implementation , he came to every meeting , throughout the time I feel like he was always curious to learn something new .  he was doing his best and was a good leader. One thing I must say is he didn’t understand the pressure i will get just because of I had to wait for people to finish their work and then I can do their html and if they want to add a button , then I have to do that as well, but I explain this to him and he didn’t understand it as I will get the effect a much , it just took him 1-2 meeting to see that I will get the hit from our process and things need to change.

Waisf - this sprint me and waist had different task so we didn’t had much talk with each other , I remember him asking me about using fetch java in html files , as he wanted a way to do implement his work in html rather than the server , but it would have been better to use the same implementation as we did with other pages by working in server file . I had a look on his comment implementation as well, it was looking promising and he did a good job on it , I am glad to have a teammate like him.

Jenna - this sprint , we had a big misunderstanding , about the deadline of the project , as she is the one who in-charged of the deadline of all, we talk in meeting about how I will send my unit testing later , as it would affect the main code or another it , it is an individual assignment , so there was a miss-communication and later we talk about this in discord as well, like we should be able to put out our unit testing as it doesn’t violate any rules, this miscommunication should have happen if she have mentioned to us in meeting properly. it was not a big issue as miscommunication happen and we could have avoid it . Rather than that Jenna code in scheduler is actually really precise and she has done a fantastic job. We work well together can me and her did the scheduler so with my implementation of html and with her code , this task was possible.

# Jenna's Review
Written by : Jenna
* I feel that, for the most part, we did better this sprint than the last two. Now that we all had experience working with GitHub and with each other as a team, we were able to avoid most of the issues we had last sprint, such as conflicting merges.
* There were still some issues with attendance, and a few cases of miscommunication when it came to deadlines near the end. If we had another sprint, I would make this a priority to be solved, because miscommunication could lead to a big issue in any project.
* Another thing that could have been done better is maintaing the KanBan board, I believe that only a few of us were regularly checking it to see what needed to be done.
        * We discussed with the Professor about how there was definitely a lack of clairty about what is an "issue" and what should be on the KanBan board, so I believe that is a big change that we would make if we had another sprint to do. 
* Overall, we have improved a lot as "software engineers" through this project, and I have learned a lot that I will keep with me going forward.
* I do feel that the end of the sprint was messy- but this could be attributed to the late Sprint 2 feedback and also finals.

### **Jurez**
* A great team member. He was at every single meeting this sprint, and took on a lot of the work, delegating tasks.
* He was also great at helping everyone when they needed it, and was always the first to reach out to someone when we weren't sure how they were doing. He helped Pratik and Wasif a lot with doing pull requests that didn't conflict with the master branch.
* He helped me with the microprocess architecture when I was struggling, and helped to delegate it among the team to make it an easier task.
* There were times where I brought up issues with his code with him, and he seemed a little hesitant to fix things or tried to find other reasons for error- I think this could have been fixed if we had met up more when there were issues in order to fix things.
* A natural leader who is great at making sure we were all on track for this project. He was a great support throughout all 3 sprints, and was always there to help others whenever we needed help.
* He was also the one that organized all of the evidence to help improve our Sprint 2 grade, which is obviously a big relief to everyone.

### **Pratik**
* Easy to work with, and did a great job on the CSS, meeting the deadline and showing us his work.
* There was some miscommunication near the end of the sprint, which caused some friction for a bit- we managed to reach a decision that made everyone happy, but in a theoretical future sprint, I would work on making sure that communication between us was more clear.
* Did a good job on all his HTML, but didn't hear from him as often as we'd like, so there were a few times we were unsure of how he was handling his tasks.
* He was very honest with his feelings, which at times caused some conflict with the group- but it was good that he was honest, it helped us to come together better as a group by getting over difficulties together.
* Rarely participated in code reviews.

### **Wasif**
* A great guy to work with, easy to get along with and talk to. Eager to work on his tasks.
* Didn't show up to every meeting, and wasn't as communicative as others so it was hard to know how he was handling tasks and if he needed help.
* He had some problems with resolving pull request conflicts, and needed to be helped with these often
* In a theoretical next sprint, I would make sure to early-on help him figure out any issues he was having, so that he could get pull requests in on time without any last-minute issues.
* Did a great job on the Comment class, and uploaded his code on time so that it could be debugged and implemented into the main project code.
* He also did a really good job of explaining his code to use, so that we could help him fix any last minute problems, and we brainstormed some ideas together that helped all of the code come together better.
* Rarely participated in code reviews.

Valuable team member with consistent attendance and task delegation. Demonstrated leadership skills and provided essential support throughout all sprints. Organized evidence for Sprint 2 grade improvement, contributing significantly to the team's success.

**Communication and Collaboration:**
Jurez is the best among us with communication. He is a very motivated guy. Whenever he finds a bug he works hard and spends time to  solve it.

*Suggested improvement:* Encourage others to work on the bugs as well as they can learn more about the problem to solve it ASAP.

**Adoption of Technologies:**
Resistance to using MongoDB for the database due to perceived complexity.

*Suggested improvement:* Explore and discuss alternative technologies collaboratively for better decision-making.

# Jurez's Team Performance Review
written by: Jurez Evans

### Overall Team's Performance review

My team's sprint 3 performance was remarkably better than the first two sprints, I think we learned from a lot of the mistakes we made in the past and finally started to work more harmoniously. Every team member was able to meet our original deadline and get their project-related code in this sprint. We also did a better job at decomposing tasks into features, and there were no incidents of multiple developer working on the same tasks and overwriting each other's tasks. Positive feedback aside, however there is still a lot of areas that we can improve as team and individually. For instance, I think in sprint three we finally started to realize that we all may have had different visions of what the final product would look like. For example, I initially thought that the topic field of our review class, was supposed to be the "topic of a performance review", for instance perhaps a hypothetical user of our application would have titled written reviews by the tasks the review was related too. This was my original interpretation from sprint 1, however a different interpretation was that the topic field was actually to indicate "which user on a team was the subject of a performance review". Both intrepretations are equally good, but the point is that we had different visions initially, as thus we at times we may have been making progress towards different "endpoints" of our final products visions. If there was a fourth sprint, my suggestion to improve this would have been to make more use of the "user story" strategy, to illustrate our visions more vividly. Another thing that our team could work on is better communication, there were multiple instances of my team members assuming that we were on the same page, while we were not, and I was also guilty of this myself. 
 
Performance review of my Team members: 

#### Jenna Performance Review
Jenna once again played a major part in planning out the initial stages of sprint three. She is a very easygoing person and a diligent worker and played a profound part in driving the team towards our common goals. The only issue I may have encountered with Jenna was that in the initial planning stages, she could have articulated her visions of some features a bit better. I think she may have felt that I was disagreeing with her vision and perhaps felt intimidated by this, where in actuality I was not being critical of her I was just listening to her viewpoints acutely, to make sure that we all could move in the same direction towards our final product.

### Pratik Performance Review
Pratik was a very reliable worker, he made every deadline for every single sprint and is very easy to work with. I think the only issue I had with Pratik was a lack of communication at times, although I also played a role in this miscommunication as it takes two parties to miscommunicate with one another. There were times when Pratik might have gotten overwhelmed under times of pressure. I think more communication would have reduced this pressure, for instance I took note in one of our meetings that perhaps the workload of developing all of the HTML pages might have been frustrating Pratik, so I suggested that we all should help him develop some of these pages as it was unfair to expect him to complete all of this work. It would have been easier to resolve issues like these if he had mentioned when help was needed from the team.
Nonetheless, Pratik was a very valuable member of the team, and he always found
a way to deliver his end of the bargain even at times when the team may have not realized that our expectations were overwhelming or unrealistic.

#### Wasif Performance Review
Wasif was also a valuable member of the team, he is keenly perceptive and makes a lot of good suggestions, and offers creative solutions. The only thing Wasif struggles with sometimes is consistency and transparency in the progress of his work. Sometimes he might leave his teammates in the dark about how far along he is with completing his work. In most cases, he is making progress towards his work, however due to the lack of communication at times, I am left wondering about far along he is with completing his tasks. I feel Wasif can improve on this aspect by giving periodic feedback in our discord channel.
