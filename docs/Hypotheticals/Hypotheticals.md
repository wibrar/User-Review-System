# "Hypotheticals- Submisions"
In this section if a group member felt it was necessary, they would have attached their
hypothetical submission to this section.

### Student Submission by Jurez:
Firstly I'm grateful towards Professor Brown and our T/A for making the neccesary ammendents
towards our grades. I think if our group had gotten sprint feed back submission sooner, we would
have invested significant more effort into making sure our sprint 3 activity was as visible as possible
in our sprint three submission. **I think the visibility of our Sprint2 activity was the biggest issue we encountered in our
feedback, but I understand why an issue like this can occur, as our evaluators have to process a large volume information from students and this
information is at times unorganize.**
Naturally, our documention of kanban board, meetings notes, and issue board
improved overtime as we progressed through the semester, however if we had realized this issue sooner
we would have made it our number one priority to make our activity as visible as possible through more organized 
documentation.
**Thus for clarity I decided it would be beneficial 
if I left a map for our evaluators to navigate through some of our sprint 3 activity.**

#### Pull request and Code review documentation
You will probably notice a few comments posted on specific pull request by me (Jurez) on the deadline night Dec 12, 2023.
These comment posts were my attempts to link each pull request to the original code review which was documented in
our meeting notes. The "Code Review" content was posted in its raw form and directly from the meeting notes, with no
changes, this was done to make navigating to our meeting notes more convenient **(by specifying the meeting note entry which documented the code review)**, and should not be intrepretted as a "last minute
code review" as this was not my intent. While in the process of doing this, I did realize that one of our code reviews were lacking,
in a case like this, I simply left an explanation, where necessary and made I no attempt "correct" these mistakes. I think this latter
point illustrate that my intent was not to "change/supplement" any code reviews, but to purely point our evaluators towards the
referencing meeting note entries. I ran out of time while doing this so the next subsection will hopefully clarify any visibility
issue related to our Sprint 3 activity. 

### Student Submission by Jenna:
For the most part, if given the Sprint 2 feedback, I would have focused more on improving our code reviews. I think for a lot of our Sprints, the code reviews were something we struggled with, and the feedback on our reviews from sprint 2 would have helped. I would have discussed with the team the things mentioned by the Professor, mainly applying more DRY and SOLID, and putting more effort into making sure everyone can attend code reviews. That way, we could all practice looking for examples- or lack of examples- of DRY and SOLID in the code, which would have helped us all get a greater understanding of these concepts.
As well, since we didnâ€™t get any feedback for the Process Analysis Document due to error with the marking, I felt like I was unable to change or improve it. If I had the feedback from Sprint 2, I would have taken time with the team to go over this document so that we could add any improvements offered by the Professor.

## Sprint 3 Activity Map
I can't guarantee that this map is comprehensive, as I can only tell a story from my perspective, and I might not be aware
of all the issues my group members individually experienced, but the ones I am aware of I will document them here if they are
relevant to our evaluation scheme.
**All of our sprint 3 activity consists of PR#118 - #178, in terms of our code submissions and documentations.**
Changes after this point were related to our "Hypotheticals" document and were permitted by Professor Brown up to December 15th

##### Documentation relevant to Code Reviews and any issues arising from them and Raised Meeting Issues.
**This section is relevant to both the Team grading and Individual grading schemes**

PR #143- Meeting note entry: November 23rd

PR #146- Meeting note entry: November 27th

Meeting note entry: November 30th
Code review: PR #148
**(Team issue #1) - Code Review issue raised:** During Jenna code review we raised two issues, one was that team_page() method
had redunant code, and should be refactored (relevant to DRY). This was raised as issue #150 (kanban board) and later resolved in 
PR# 158  between code lines 373 -385 (These commits are somewhere between December 2nd to 4th). 

This code review also
raised **(Team issue #2)- code review**, a bug was spotted in the account module and tracked on kanban board as issue #153, this bug was later fixed in
PR # 159.

**(Team issue #3)- Meeting issue raised** : After our code review was conducted, I also raised the point that our HTML developer Pratik
needed assistance with implementing some of the HTML Pages. Reference to this discussion is documented in our Nov 30th 
entry. 
Issue resolution: Later on December 4th, Pr #158 and #159 sought to resolve this issue, Jenna and I assisted Pratik with these tasks, a 
code review was done directly on github. 

December 1st - This was a Friday, so we did our code reviews remotely and left comments on github.
Code Review: PR # 152 - Remote code review (there was no scheduled class), This code review was done directly
on github.

**(Team issue #4)- Code Review Issues raised**: We noted that Pratik's code submission (PR#152) likely violated the openness/closeness 
principle of the SOLID convention, and that we would have to make improvements later. 
Issue Resolution: This was documented on the kanban board as item #154 and then later fixed in Pull request # 159 and thus resolved this issue.

Pr # 156 - A code review was not applicable here, explanation given on git-hub. We simply verified that
project files were still functioning.

PR# 160 and PR#161 - These pull request were done directly on github. 
The pull requests after #161 were documentation related and are not relevant for code reviews.

Meeting note entry: December 10th **(Team issue #5)**
This issue was documented as issue #169 and our team resolved this issue by discussion on discord,
a summary of our discussion is seen on the Issue Board under item #169.

### Student Submission by Wasif:
I hope this message finds you in good health. Firstly, I would like to express my appreciation for your dedication in facilitating the necessary adjustments to our grades. Your commitment to fair evaluations does not go unnoticed.

I wanted to provide some additional context regarding the challenges I faced during Sprint 3. Unfortunately, the results for Sprint 2 came in late for me, limiting the time available for me to implement improvements in Sprint 3. Despite the extension provided, my attention was divided due to other exams, making it challenging to focus entirely on the sprint. As a result, I couldn't contribute as many pull requests as I would have liked.

The code were mainly discussedd in class or in github general as shown in the team meeting notes.. If the marks for sprint2 were given earlier we would have created a code review file where all the feedback, challenges, bugs, and Code reviews wrer mentioned according to every pull request. This method would have give a better understanding of code review and give more insight to individual participation during the code reviews. I mostly worked project server and review.py file alongside a team member, so my unit test may not have worked as my team members have updated server and review files till the last code deadline due to which I was not able to update my unit test file. Furthermore, my pull requests were rejected, due to this Code production and time spent shows a serious effort undertaken was also effected.
